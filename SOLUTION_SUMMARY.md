# Solution Summary: R2 Image Fetch Error Fix

## Quick Start

If you're seeing `502 Bad Gateway` errors with `OPTIMIZED_EXTERNAL_IMAGE_REQUEST_UNAUTHORIZED` for R2 images:

### 1. Enable R2 Public Access
- Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → R2 → Your Bucket → Settings → Public Access
- Click "Allow Access"
- Copy the public URL (e.g., `https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev`)

### 2. Add Environment Variable

**Local (.env.local):**
```env
R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev
```

**Vercel:**
- Project Settings → Environment Variables
- Add: `R2_PUBLIC_URL` = `https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev`

### 3. Redeploy
Your images should now load correctly!

## What Was Changed

### Code Changes (2 files)

#### 1. `actions/work-image.ts`
Added logic to use public R2 URLs when `R2_PUBLIC_URL` environment variable is set:

```typescript
const publicUrl = process.env.R2_PUBLIC_URL;

if (publicUrl) {
    const publicUrls = files.map((key) => ({
        key,
        url: `${publicUrl}/${key}`,
    }));
    return publicUrls;
}
// Falls back to signed URLs if R2_PUBLIC_URL not set
```

#### 2. `next.config.js`
Added remote pattern to allow R2 public URLs:

```javascript
{
    protocol: "https",
    hostname: "**.r2.dev",
    port: "",
    pathname: "/**",
}
```

### Documentation Added (4 files)

1. **R2_SETUP.md** - Configuration instructions
2. **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Detailed troubleshooting guide
3. **.env.local.example** - Environment variable examples
4. **README.md** - Updated with setup instructions

## Why This Fix Works

### The Problem
```
Browser Request → Next.js Image Optimizer → Private R2 Endpoint
                                           ↓
                                    ❌ 502 UNAUTHORIZED
```

Vercel's Next.js Image Optimization cannot authenticate with private R2 storage endpoints, even with signed URLs.

### The Solution
```
Browser Request → Next.js Image Optimizer → Public R2 URL
                                           ↓
                                    ✅ 200 OK + Optimized Image
```

Public R2 URLs don't require authentication and work perfectly with Next.js Image Optimization.

## Benefits

✅ **Images Load**: No more 502 errors
✅ **Optimized**: Automatic WebP conversion, resizing, quality optimization
✅ **Fast**: Better caching and CDN distribution
✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Existing code continues to work
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Still supports signed URLs if needed

## Technical Details

### Why Signed URLs Don't Work with Vercel Image Optimization

1. **Signature Validation**: AWS/S3 signed URLs validate the exact request signature
2. **Proxy Modification**: Vercel's image optimizer acts as a proxy and may modify the request
3. **Header Changes**: Additional headers can invalidate the signature
4. **Timing Issues**: Cached URLs may be reused after signature expiration
5. **IP/Origin Mismatch**: Request originates from Vercel's servers, not the expected origin

### Security Considerations

**Public URLs**:
- ✅ Standard for website assets (logos, screenshots, project images)
- ✅ Works with CDN and caching
- ⚠️ Anyone with the URL can access the images

**For Private Images**:
- Use `unoptimized` prop on Next.js Image component
- Or implement API route proxy with authentication
- Or use client-side rendering

## Verification Checklist

After implementing the fix:

- [ ] R2 bucket has public access enabled
- [ ] `R2_PUBLIC_URL` added to `.env.local` (local dev)
- [ ] `R2_PUBLIC_URL` added to Vercel environment variables (production)
- [ ] Application redeployed on Vercel
- [ ] Images load without errors
- [ ] Browser DevTools shows 200 OK for image requests
- [ ] Images are being optimized (check `/_next/image` URLs)

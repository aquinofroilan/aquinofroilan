                            I work as a web developer and have a passion for creating scalable, maintainable, and
                            sophisticated applications utilizing contemporary JavaScript technologies, especially React
                            and its powerful Next.js, the framework that powers this website. In terms of service and
                            backend architecture, I use platforms such as Firebase for smooth authentication and,
                            Supabase for database orchestration integration.

                            I recently received my information technology bachelor&apos;s degree in 2025. I have a very
                            self-directed approach to learningâ€”I actively use AI-based tools like ChatGPT and websites
                            like YouTube, FreeCodeCamp and, Claude to deepen my understanding and, reaffirm ideas.

                            A growing interest in UI/UX design complements my programming journey, which I develop using

                            I am currently broadening my technical foundation by studying system-level programming
                            languages such as C and Go, with the aim of deepening my understanding of low-level
                            operations and, enhancing my algorithmic thinking. In parallel, I am deepening my abstract
                            thinking and, understanding with regards to Data Structures and Algorithms, how to optimize
                            systems.

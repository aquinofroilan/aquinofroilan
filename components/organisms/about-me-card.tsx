                            I work as a web developer and have a passion for creating scalable, maintainable, and
                            sophisticated applications utilizing contemporary JavaScript technologies, especially React
                            and its powerful Next.js, the framework that powers this website. In terms of service and
                            backend architecture, I use platforms such as Firebase for smooth authentication and
                            Supabase for database orchestration integration.

                            I recently received my information technology bachelor&apos;s degree in 2025, and I&apos;m
                            still expanding my knowledge outside of the classroom. I have a very self-directed approach
                            to learningâ€”I actively use AI-based tools like ChatGPT and websites like YouTube and
                            FreeCode. and Claude to deepen my understanding and reaffirm ideas. My inquisitive nature
                            frequently results in examining subjects using Dev.to, Medium, and technical discussions on
                            GitHub and Stack Overflow. archives.

                            A growing interest in UI/UX design complements my programming journey, which I develop using

                            I plan to explore system-level languages like C and Go soon in order to expand my low-level
                            comprehension and algorithmic problem-solving skills. Additionally, I&apos;m exploring Java
                            and Kotlin and will take a native approach to mobile development. At the same time, I&apos;m
                            strengthening my mathematical underpinnings for a future shift to machine learning and
                            artificial intelligence, areas that appeal to me on a rational and imaginative level.
